GH Subject Line Encoder
=======================
***Utility for encoding Subject Line, Preheader and Fine print text for Cheetah Mail emails.***


**Encoding**<br>
Using an array of values to split/join the string input, this utilitie provides quick subject line "scrubbing" for encoded elements. This is not an exhaustive tool and at the moment only encodes a handful of elements, the hope is that over time it can be more exhaustive.
